# Φ-Cosmography · FAQ

## What is this site?

This site presents **Cosmography** — a structural description of reality.

It defines relations, boundaries, and invariants
without interpretation, execution, or prediction.

Nothing here acts.
Nothing here responds.

---

## What am I supposed to do here?

Nothing.

You are not a user.
You are a reader.

This site operates in **Reading Mode** only.

---

## Why is there no interaction, UI, or controls?

Because Cosmography is not an application.

It does not:
- react,
- respond,
- update,
- adapt.

Any interaction belongs to external systems, not to this one.
