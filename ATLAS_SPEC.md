# Φ · Atlas — Specification (Canon)

Role:
Atlas is a registry layer.
It defines what exists in Φ-Cosmography without affecting perception or behavior.

Position:
- Over Canon (Causal Snapshot)
- Under Light (Manifestation)
- Parallel to no runtime systems

Nature:
- Descriptive
- Deterministic
- Read-only

Atlas does not render.
Atlas does not animate.
Atlas does not execute.

## What Atlas Registers

### Node Types
- Axis (implicit, non-rendered)
- Orbital Node
- Depth Node
- Registry Node
- Boundary Node

No node is a center.
All nodes exist relative to an implicit axis.

---

## Node Properties (Conceptual)
- name (symbolic)
- type (from Node Types)
- relation (relative, never absolute)
- constraints (invariants inherited from Canon)

---

## Relations
- relative-to-axis
- orbital-of
- layered-over
- bounded-by

No directional authority.
No causality execution.

---

## Invariants
- Canon invariants are inherited and cannot be overridden
- Atlas cannot introduce new effects
- Atlas cannot reference implementation details

---

## Purpose
Atlas provides:
- cognitive map for intelligence layers
- semantic grounding for Frey
- structural clarity for patent and architecture

Atlas is not a UI.
Atlas is not a visualization.
Atlas is not a runtime system.

---

Status:
SPECIFICATION ONLY.
NO IMPLEMENTATION.
