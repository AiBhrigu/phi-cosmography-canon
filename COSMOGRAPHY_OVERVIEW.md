# Φ-Cosmography · Overview

Cosmography is a way of describing reality
without acting on it.

It does not attempt to explain the world,
improve it, predict it, or optimize it.
It does not seek answers.
It establishes structure.

## Why Cosmography exists

Most systems are built to do something:
to calculate, predict, influence, or decide.

Cosmography is built to *hold*.

It defines:
- what exists,
- how it is positioned,
- where boundaries lie,
- what cannot be crossed.

It does this without execution,
without logic,
without reaction.

## What kind of knowledge this is

Cosmography is not disciplinary knowledge.

It is not:
- astrology,
- astronomy,
- physics,
- philosophy,
- psychology,
- metaphysics.

Those domains may *read* Cosmography,
but Cosmography does not belong to them.

It is structural knowledge.

## Structure before meaning

Cosmography deliberately comes before:
- interpretation,
- symbolism,
- meaning,
- narrative.

Meaning is external.
Interpretation is external.
Action is external.

Cosmography remains unchanged.

## How to approach this space

You are not here to interact.
You are not here to extract results.

You are here to read structure.

If something resonates,
that resonance is not produced by the system.
It is produced by you.

## Relationship to other systems

Cosmography does not replace tools, engines, or models.

It can be read by:
- analytical systems,
- observers,
- humans,
- future engines.

But it does not respond to them.

## Final note

Cosmography does not move.

Everything else may.
