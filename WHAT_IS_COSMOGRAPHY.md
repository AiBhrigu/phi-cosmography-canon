# What is Cosmography

Cosmography is a structural description of reality.

It defines causal relations, invariants, and boundaries
without interpretation, execution, or prediction.

Cosmography does not act.
Cosmography defines the space in which action may later appear.

This site presents Cosmography as a read-only structure,
organized around an implicit axis that is never rendered.

Nothing here is a center.
Everything exists relative to cause.
