# Φ-Cosmography · Canon

This repository is the **canonical foundation** of Φ-Cosmography.
It is not an experiment. It is not a playground.

## Φ-Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

- SunCore is an **axis**, not a module.
- Helion is an **orbital manifestation**, never a center.
- AUREL is an **internal compass**, never a public label.
- One effect → one parameter.
- No install scripts.
- No inline styles.
- No build artifacts in git.

## Roles

### SunCore
Silent gravitational axis.  
Present conceptually. Not rendered directly.

### Helion
Orbital light.  
Never competes with SunCore.

### Inner Core
Depth, not authority.

## Gates

Any change requires:
- no new center emergence
- no explanation text required
- zero visual aggression

## Forbidden Forever

- dist/ in git
- duplicated paths
- visual magic as compensation
- naming the center
