Canon status: LOCKED

This repository is sealed as a read-only Canon.
No edits, refactors, or semantic changes are permitted.

Any future work must occur:
- in a new repository, or
- in a new cycle with explicit declaration.

Canon remains a reference, not a process.

Lock established intentionally.
