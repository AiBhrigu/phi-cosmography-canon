# Φ-Cosmography · Canon Readiness Declaration

Status: READY  
Layer: Canon  
Mode: Read-only  

This document declares the Canon layer of Φ-Cosmography
structurally complete and sealed.

## Scope

- Canon only
- No runtime
- No execution
- No mutation
- No interaction

## Guarantees

The Canon layer:
- defines structure only
- contains no logic or behavior
- produces no outcomes
- issues no instructions
- grants no authority

All content is descriptive.
All relations are static.
All boundaries are fixed.

## Reader Position

The reader is external.

Meaning, interpretation, decision, and action
exist outside Canon.

Canon does not observe the reader.
Canon does not respond.

## Change Policy

Any modification requires:

- new version boundary
- separate audit

Without this, Canon remains immutable.
