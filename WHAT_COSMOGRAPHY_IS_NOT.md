# What Cosmography Is Not

Cosmography is not a product.
Cosmography is not a service.
Cosmography is not an application.

It does not provide answers.
It does not give advice.
It does not make predictions.

Cosmography is not astrology.
Cosmography is not astronomy.
Cosmography is not philosophy.

It does not explain meaning.
It does not interpret symbols.
It does not guide decisions.

There is no personalization.
There is no optimization.
There is no interaction.

Cosmography does not respond.
Cosmography does not adapt.
Cosmography does not evolve by itself.

This is not a dashboard.
This is not an interface.
This is not an experience.

If you are looking for results — this is not it.
If you are looking for tools — this is not it.

Cosmography defines structure.
Everything else happens elsewhere.
