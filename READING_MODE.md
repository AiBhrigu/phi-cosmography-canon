This site operates in Reading Mode.

Nothing here reacts to you.
Nothing here changes because of you.
Nothing here is activated by attention.

You are not a user.
You are an observer.

There are no controls.
There are no triggers.
There are no actions.

The structure is fixed.
The relations are static.
The cause is already defined.

Reading Mode means:
- You read what exists.
- You do not influence what exists.
- You do not extract outcomes.

If something appears meaningful,
that meaning does not come from the system.
It comes from you.

Reading Mode is intentional.
Reading Mode is final.
