# Public Reader Context
*(How to read Φ-Cosmography)*

This space is not designed to engage you.
It does not adapt, respond, or guide.

Φ-Cosmography exists to be read, not used.

## What this is

Φ-Cosmography presents a structural map.

It describes relations, boundaries, invariants,
and causal positioning.

It does not describe outcomes.
It does not explain meaning.
It does not perform analysis.

Nothing here executes.

## What this is not

This is not:
- a product or a service
- a tool, platform, or application
- a dashboard or interface
- a simulator or engine
- an AI system
- a recommendation system
- an analytics framework

It does not provide:
- forecasts or predictions
- advice or guidance
- personalization
- optimization

It does not react to attention.
It does not change based on reading.

## Clarification

Although Cosmography may reference
celestial structures, symbolic layers,
or historical patterns,

it is not astrology,
not astronomy,
not philosophy,
not metaphysics.

Any similarity is structural only.

## Reader position

You are not a user.
You are an observer.

Nothing expects action from you.
Nothing progresses because of you.

If something appears meaningful,
that meaning is external to this system.

## Boundary

All interpretation happens elsewhere.

Cosmography remains unchanged.

If you are looking for answers or tools,
this is not the place.
